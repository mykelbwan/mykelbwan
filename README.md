# Hi i'm Mykel Bwan

Full-stack engineer with a focus on **backend systems, blockchain, and applied AI**.  
I build production-oriented software with an emphasis on correctness, scalability, and clear system design.

My work spans backend APIs, modern frontend interfaces, and AI agents powered by LLM frameworks. I’m especially interested in systems that combine **software engineering discipline with emerging technologies**.

## Technical Focus

**Backend**
- Node.js (TypeScript), Python  
- Express, FastAPI  
- API design, data modeling, service architecture

**Frontend**
- React, Svelte  
- Tailwind CSS  
- Clean, minimal UI with strong DX

**AI / Agents**
- LangGraph  
- ReAct agents  
- RAG pipelines and agent orchestration

**Infrastructure & Tooling**
- Docker  
- AWS, Contabo, Railway  
- Environment-driven deployments and CI-friendly workflows

## How I Work

- Design before implementation: clear interfaces and responsibilities  
- Preference for simple, maintainable solutions over clever abstractions  
- Production mindset: logging, failure modes, and deployment are first-class concerns  
- Documentation that explains *why*, not just *how*

---

## What I’m Interested In

- AI agents that solve real operational problems  
- Blockchain systems beyond hype: incentives, correctness, and trust  
- Early-stage products where engineering decisions matter
